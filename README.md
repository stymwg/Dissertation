This repository contains nine R-scripts used to generate results for my Project identifying candidate genomic regions under immediate variatio post-WGD in Mimulus guttatus.
The number of each script corresponds to the number given in the 'Code' section of the project and in superscript in the 'Methods' section.
The function of each script is listed below:
1. R-script that generates PCA and NJ tree
2. R-script that extracts upper 99th percentile outliers
3. R-script that determines Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation Coefficient
4. R-script that plots linkage disequilibrium
5. R-script that generates absolute AFD plots
6. R-script that calculate the significance of overlap between orthologous loci
7. R script that produces cn.mops-generated lists of candidate CNVs
8. R-script that generates frequency histograms and dot-plots for identified CNVs
9. R-script that plots mean normalized coverage for diploid and tetraploid populations.
